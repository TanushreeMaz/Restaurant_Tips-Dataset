# Predicting Restaurant Tips Using Predictive Analytics on Excel
An Business Analysis with Excel, on Restaurant Tips received as per time, gender, holidays, meals and many more ways to check the tips to restaurants

The project focuses on developing a mathematical model to forecast restaurant tip amounts using a predictive equation. 

I attempted to complete the project in two ways: first, by using Excel, and then by utilizing Power Query for data cleaning and preparation for analysis.

I used Pivot Charts to conduct a thorough analysis of the data, examining various aspects to identify where tipping habits differ across different scenarios.

Determine the independent and dependent variables.

I then calculated the linear relationship with the dependent variables using correlation.

I developed a regression model to examine the coefficient, R-squared value, and p-value.

 Also calculated the predicted tip and error percentage to assess the accuracy of the predictions.
